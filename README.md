# Techtrends

TechTrends is an online website used as a news sharing platform, that enables consumers to access the latest news within the cloud-native ecosystem. In addition to accessing the available articles, readers are able to create new media articles and share them with the wider community.

This project uses Docker to package the application, and automate the Continuous Integration process with GitHub Actions. For the release process, we use Kubernetes declarative manifests, which were templated using Helm. To automate the Continuous Delivery process, we have used ArgoCD.
